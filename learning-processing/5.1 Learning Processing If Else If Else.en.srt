1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,041
Ok, here we are again.

2
00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:04,991
Welcome

3
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:07,914
we are at the beginning of something
what's happening here is

4
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:12,648
if you recall, we are talking about
how to have a program

5
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:14,925
choose a path essentially.

6
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:20,334
How do we have a program execute some code
sometimes and other code other times

7
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:25,714
We are doing that with 
a conditional statement

8
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:27,705
A conditional statement involves saying:

9
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:32,888
<b>if</b> this condition is met <b>then</b> execute
the lines of code in between

10
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:35,583
the open and curly close brackets.

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,361
We can see an example of that running
over here which we built in the last video

12
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,417
I dressed it up a little bit.
There is now a white line over here

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:48,177
that shows us if the mouse is over here
is less than 100 pixels

14
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:51,410
and is not executing that code
which draws a red background

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:57,823
but as soon as I move the mouse over...
clicking the window and have it focused

16
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:01,297
and move the mouse over we can see
we now have a red background.

17
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:02,314
No red background

18
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:03,253
Red background

19
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:04,130
No red background

20
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,045
Red background

21
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:08,015
Our program is doing something different
each time through draw

22
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,498
based on a condition.

23
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:11,412
This is how everything works.

24
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:15,363
If you are programming Pong:
if the ball hits the paddle

25
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:19,252
then change the ball direction
and if the ball go passed the paddle

26
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,352
change the score, etc.

27
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:24,594
This is what we're doing: we
we just want to be able to set a condition

28
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:27,046
and execute different code
based on those conditions

29
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,909
everything you do is gonna be
sort of thinking through

30
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,854
and design that logic.

31
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,625
So that's the beginning of this,

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,968
there are a few more pieces
that we want to get through

33
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:40,992
for example: what if we were to say
"i wanna draw another line

34
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:43,883
i wanna draw a line that is
a little bit further over

35
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:49,086
and it is at 200 pixels".

36
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:52,138
Let me run this now

37
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:56,324
200 and that's a little mistake there.
I wanto also the top of the line

38
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,202
to be at 200 pixels.

39
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:03,100
So... here we have black background,
here we have red background,

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,039
here we have... red background.

41
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,019
What if I want a third option:
black to red to, say, blue?

42
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:19,099
I know I can say (typing):
if mouseX is greater than 200

43
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,959
draw a blue background.

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,379
I think we're gonna have 
that program working out

45
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,159
black

46
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,160
red

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,885
blue

48
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,226
depending on where the mouse is.

49
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,574
black, red, blue.

50
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:35,864
Here's the thing: what is going on here?

51
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,338
There are two different cases:

52
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:42,194
if the mouse is greater than 100
execute this code.

53
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:49,751
If the mouse is greater than 200
execute this code.

54
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:53,786
but we are actually testing both of these.
We are actually drawing a red background

55
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,843
and we are drawing a blue background.

56
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,983
What if we have something different
where instead of drawing a background

57
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:05,468
we want to draw some rectangles.

58
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:09,264
So let's just say: 
let's make a red rectangle

59
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:12,544
and I'll put it somewhere on the screen

60
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:22,777
and while we're here,
we will draw a green rectangle

61
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:25,411
and we will put it a little bit lower down

62
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:28,829
So, what's is going on here?

63
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,016
no rectangle

64
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,393
red rectangle

65
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,115
and the green rectangle

66
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:34,212
no green rectangle

67
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:35,748
green rectangle

68
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,945
no rectangles.

69
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,543
But if I want the green rectangle
to appear here

70
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,930
and the red one disappear.

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,442
In this case here what 
take the mouse's at 400?

72
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:50,393
If the mouse is at 400
it's greater than 100

73
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:51,965
and greater than 200

74
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,410
so we are going to see the red
rectangle and the green rectangle.

75
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,575
There is another way we can start to 
make this code work slightly differently.

76
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,964
What if we want to exclusively only
execute one of these?

77
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:11,340
What if we want to, let's say, this:

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:21,018
(writing)
else if mouse X is greater than 200.

79
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,418
Now, this look similar

80
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:30,776
If the mouse is greater than 100
If the mouse is greater than 200

81
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:34,506
If the mouse is greater than 100
else if the mouse is greater than 200.

82
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:41,386
We can think of this "else if"
as the word otherwise if

83
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,716
I hate this video 
that I'm making right now

84
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,065
I have to just keep going...

85
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:52,041
This is gonna be fine,
we will remake all of these anyway

86
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,561
If the mouse is greater than 100
otherwise if the mouse is greater than 200

87
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,879
The thing, what's important here, 
there's is something important here

88
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,645
that we are totally missing.

89
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,690
The thing that's important here
with this structure "else if"

90
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,764
with the structure if 
both of these can happen

91
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:14,092
With the structure else if
only one of these can ever be executed

92
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:18,048
The interesting thing is:
this is a huge mistake we've made here.

93
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:22,029
Pause the video. Don't pause it yet.
Wait.

94
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,481
Take a look at this.
Something is horribly wrong.

95
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,094
Syntax is fine... It'll run,
Processing will give zero errors

96
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,923
but we are gonna have a problem.

97
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:32,825
Pause the video and think about that,
and then come back.

98
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:36,556
Ok, you're back. Let's go over here
and put that code in

99
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:44,287
So I'm gonna say... (typing) else if
the mouseX is greater than 200

100
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:47,747
so I revise this code.

101
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:52,124
The mouse is about 50 pixels
it's not greater than 100,

102
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:56,255
it's not greater than 200,
we're just not seeing any rectangles.

103
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,923
The mouse is now greater than 100,
we're seeing a red rectangle

104
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,129
that's what we expected to see

105
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,202
Let's stand here,
it's better when I stand here.

106
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,585
Now I move over here.
What's happening?

107
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:18,414
The mouse is greater than 200
but there is no green rectangle

108
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:20,638
Why is that?

109
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,522
Let's think about it.

110
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:28,690
Let's say for the moment:
what happens when the mouse x is 150?

111
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,883
If mouse X is 150 this is true,
so we execute this code

112
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,815
we don't execute this code.

113
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:39,768
With an else if the first thing we find
to be true we leave.

114
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:46,195
If mouse X is 250.
250 is greater than 100

115
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:50,083
execute this code.
We leave. We're done.

116
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:58,645
What happen if I make this 200 
and I make this 100?

117
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:02,997
All this weird logic stuff that 
you're stuck thinking about all the time

118
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:04,640
Let's make this 200

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,937
It's just like 7 minutes,
this is a disaster.

120
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,887
This should be like a 3 minutes video
just going over else if and elses

121
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:14,486
this is my life right now...

122
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:16,923
Here we go

123
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,998
Mouse x is here

124
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,158
now I've got a green rectangle

125
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,167
now I've got a red rectangle

126
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:23,886
green rectangle

127
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,074
red rectangle

128
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:25,849
Why?

129
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,595
Because when it's 250 
we're executing this code

130
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,009
and skipping out

131
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,370
when it's 150, this become false
if this's false, we can check the next one

132
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,694
and the next one is true 
and then we skip out.

133
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:41,846
With else if when you have an if statement
joined with an else if

134
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,903
you only ever do one of these.

135
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:50,596
And we can even go so far, just to say,
else if mouse x is greater than 50...

136
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,726
we can join this as many as we want.

137
00:07:52,726 --> 00:07:55,457
Let's go over here and add that in

138
00:07:55,457 --> 00:08:04,846
We're going to say... let's start with 500
400, just keep adding more of these in

139
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:07,353
we can see we're gonna have
a whole bunch of these

140
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:17,290
300, 200, and we can have 
different colors

141
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:25,993
different locations
with different sizes...

142
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,728
Let's see what happens now.

143
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,303
You know what? This was nice
having these lines there

144
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,078
so let's add all the lines
so we can see where all the stuff is

145
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:45,243
Set a line at 300 and 400.

146
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,938
And 100 doesn't do anything anymore
or maybe it does

147
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:52,651
we need a line at 500.

148
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:56,785
This video is a disaster. 
I have to remake these.

149
00:08:56,785 --> 00:09:00,608
I haven't really though this thru yet,
I should this after something or whatever

150
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:08,970
This is all like a mess and it's all wrong
everything is wrong

151
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,699
What's going on here?

152
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,211
These pixels makes no sense

153
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,346
these weird (unintelligible) like
one (unintelligible) rectangular design

154
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,735
that we've made.
What's going on?

155
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:24,821
The point that we are emphasizing here
is that what we're doing is

156
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:29,394
with this if statement
we're creating a set of possibilities

157
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,149
only one of which can be executed

158
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,111
So first we see if we're greater than 500

159
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,439
if that's not true we see
if it's greater than 400

160
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,225
if that's not true 300, etc.

161
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:41,557
This is essentially the kind of logic
you want to start programming

162
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:44,762
if you want 
to create rollovers essentially

163
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:47,393
we've created this regions
that when mouse is over them

164
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:48,581
something happen.

165
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:53,790
Something you may try to do
as an exercise right now

166
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,654
because this video is so clearly
explain all this perfectly

167
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,539
and (unintelligible) to miss 
the important part

168
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,292
which is like what else if is

169
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:04,147
I should just start this over
but I'm not gonna start it over

170
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:22,597
(rumbling)

171
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,686
This is fine, 
this is gonna be a long video

172
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:28,037
later this is gonna be shorter
we'll been redoing all these anyway

173
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:31,800
everything is ok, we're calm
we're fine, you're listening

174
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,577
(rumbling)

175
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,118
The exercise for you:

176
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:45,915
here's your Processing window
divide it into four quadrants

177
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:50,174
and have the quadrants highlight
whenever you move the mouse over them

178
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:53,556
so the mouse should be here, 
that's the mouse

179
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:55,504
and this is showing that's highlighted

180
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,601
As you move the mouse over
create this regions rollover

181
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,051
it's very similar to what 
we've done over here

182
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:04,248
the only differences is instead of these
horizontal regions

183
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,287
this vertical line sections

184
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:08,385
you've got a section screen 
on a grid

185
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:13,805
Here's what kind did't say:
with any if statement

186
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,608
we can also have an else.
