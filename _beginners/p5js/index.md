This video series focuses on the fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditions, iteration, functions & objects) using JavaScript. In particular it leverages the p5.js creative computing environment which is oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones. The series is designed for computer programming novices.

Hopefully if you make it to the end you'll be able to explain how computational media is different from traditional media, demonstrate an understanding of computer programming, and learn how to pick up the tools you need to accomplish the projects that interest you in computational media.
