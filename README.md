# Future Live Streams

I am trying as best I can to announce the next live streams in advance. If it's scheduled you can find the time and topics on the the official [Coding Train website](http://thecodingtrain.com) homepage. All times are in EDT and are subject to change! You can confirm the exact time by visiting [The Coding Train Live](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/live). I typically add a specific time on YouTube in the morning.

# Topics Under Consideration
I keep track of topics [in this repo](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Topics/), but also a list of notes is here for me not to forget.
* word2vec
* K-means clustering?
* Mappa p5 library (traveling sales on a map?)
* boids coding challenge
* Promises
* Bayesian text classification
* `exec()` with node (densecap with p5 and node?)
* iTerm
* Alexa skill 
* dialogflow

# Add your own variation

If you want to share your own variation based on a Coding Train video, you can also do this by visiting the page corresponding to the video on our [website](http://thecodingtrain.com). Check out the [Community Contributions Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Community-Contributions-Guide) to see how it's done. It will then be featured right under the video on the website for everyone to see!

# Help adding new videos

We are currently in the process of migrating videos and community contributions to the new system. If you want to help with this, have a look at the [Content Contribution Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Content-Contribution-Guide). Thanks for helping us out!
