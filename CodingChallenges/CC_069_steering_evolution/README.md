  * A new "dynasty" is added to the system automatically when there are no vehicles left. The new dynasty will be based on prev generation champion’s DNA. Probability of reproduction also related to a requested minimum health value.
  * Press CTRL to toggle debug on/off.
  * Mouse press for adding new vehicles.
  * Press ALT toggle 'tamagotchi mode' ON/OFF (if ON MousePress + 'F' to add food - MousePress + 'P' to add poison)

  * Press Enter to toggle visibility and perception radii and display current fittest boid.
  * Click on the screen to create more food, mess with evolution and create a new fittest boid.

  * Written in Processing.
  * Press D to toggle debugging information.
  * Press S to toggle statistical information.
  * Press A to save simulation data to a CSV file.
  * More information in readme.

[Repository](https://github.com/origapepe/Evolutionary-Steering-Behaviors)| [Demo](https://origapepe.github.io/Evolutionary-Steering-Behaviors/)
  *Improved the reproduction function
  * All vehicles have a sex (male or female)
  *A better description of the reproduce function in readme
  
  #### Versions By: [Simon Tiger](https://github.com/simon-tiger)
   * Game in Processing ([Repository](https://github.com/simon-tiger/Game_SteeringBehaviorsEvolution))
     * I am now highlighting the best one
     * Something moving around with perlin noise adds poison (instead of just adding poison randomly)
     * Hopefully, soon I will make p5.js version

#### Predators!
#### By: [Elton Doehnert](https://github.com/Doehnert)
[Repository](https://github.com/Doehnert/predators) | [Demo](https://doehnert.github.io/predators/)
  * Instead of poison there are predators that pursuit the preys
  * The faster the prey moves, the faster is dies
  * The predator evolves his maxspeed, prey perception and prey weight
  * The preys evolves Food weight, Food perception, Poison/Prey weight, Poison/Prey perception, maxspeed

#### Slider Inputs
#### By: [Addison H](https://github.com/addyh)
[Repository](https://github.com/addyh/addyh.github.io/tree/master/evolutionary-steering) | [Demo](https://addyh.github.io/evolutionary-steering/)
  * Features sliders to modify global values and DNA mutations.
  * Lists out the stats of all vehicles, highlighting the best.
  
#### Object Oriented Java-Version
#### By: [Kim](https://github.com/kim-marcel)
[Repository](https://github.com/kim-marcel/evolutionary_steering)
  * Press 'd' to toggle Debug-Mode
  * Press space-bar to generate a new ant at a random location with random genes
  * Left-click: Add new food
  * Right-click: Add new poison
  * Predators eat poison and ants
